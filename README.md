# Image Segmentation and Synthetic Dataset Generation Library  

This library is designed to process tomographic images for medical research, enabling segmentation of anatomical structures, finite element mesh generation, and synthetic dataset creation for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).  

## Features  
- **Segmentation**: Automatically segment tomographic images into human thoracic cavity organs.  
- **Finite Element Mesh Generation**: Generate geometry and finite element meshes with predefined conductivity for FEMM software.  
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Create synthetic EIT datasets for scientific research and experimentation.  

## Use Cases  
- Medical research in EIT measurement analysis and synthetic dataset generation.  
- Finite element model generation for industrial design, game engines, and simulation tasks.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

# Now library is in early stages of development
